# Machine-Learning-Algos
The repository contains three files which are implementations of machine learning algorithms.
1. Linear regression using gradient descent method - Data used is the boston housing.
2. Decision tree - Performance is tested on a graph of Accuracy vs number of nodes and Accuracy vs depth of the tree
3. Naive Bayes - ROC curve is used to demonstrate performance of the classifier
